## STEPS TO FOLLOW.

**NOTE:** the `fetch()` function is also an api, so if you see fetch api, it is referring to the function `fetch` not the REST api you chose.

- create a "function" `get()` that retrieves data from the chosen API
- use that data to display information to the user.
- create a button that when click will run the function again.
- create an `<input type="number"/>` that runs a function to get an item from your api by id.
